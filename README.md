# [Movies Search Application](http://movie-search.meanpro.com/) by [Meanpro](http://www.meanpro.com/)

## Problem Statement

As a solution to this problem, you are supposed to create an application that enables
user to search movie titles using various parameters - By Imdb Id or title or year.
It should have only one view containing a search screen which enables users to provide
these inputs. You have to write Jquery code to change the requests according to
options selected by user and show the response received(search results) by the API in
form of cards containing all the information available in the response. If you receive a
poster image, you have to display that as well and if its not available, it should display a
dummy picture.
